     <p>
     You can truly use any salmon for this recipe,
     but I find that 4- to 5-ounce portions work best.
     This is approximately what you would want for a serving anyway.
     Plus, it’s the best size for the air to flow around the salmon evenly,
     ensuring it cooks perfectly at the same time.
     </p>
     <p>Salmon is a quick, easy, and healthy dinner option.
        While there are many ways to make salmon from baking and grilling
        it to simply searing it in a pan, the air fryer is a fantastic option,
        especially if you are trying to make four servings or less!

     <p>This recipe takes about 5 Min to Prepare</p>
     <p>Cook time is 10 minutes</p>
     <p>Serves 4 servings</p>

    <h1>Ingredients.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Nonstick spray</li>
        <li>4 (4- to 5-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper (or 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Prepare the air fryer basket</h2>
            <p>spray the inside of the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray.
            </p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Season the salmon</h2>
            <p>
            Place the salmon on a plate skin side down. Drizzle the tops (the skinless sides)
            with olive oil and season with lemon pepper, salt, and black pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Air fry the salmon</h2>
            <p>
            Place the salmon in the air fryer basket. Make sure they aren’t touching.
            I like to place mine skin-side down, but skin-side up is also an option.
            If you’d like, place a few lemon slices under each piece of salmon.
            Air fry the salmon for about 8 minutes at 350˚F.
            The salmon is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 135°F to 140˚F when
            measured with an instant read thermometer. You can cook it longer if you want a slightly more
            well-done piece.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Serve the salmon</h2>
            <p>
            Serve the salmon with fresh lemon wedges for squeezing on top.
            Refrigerate leftover salmon for up to 3 days.
